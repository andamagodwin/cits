  student_id TEXT,
  year_of_study TEXT NOT NULL,
  experience_level TEXT NOT NULL,

);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE membership_applications ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can submit applications" ON membership_applications
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

-- Create a policy that allows admins to read all applications
CREATE POLICY "Admins can read applications" ON membership_applications
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
